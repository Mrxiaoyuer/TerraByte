# Start the two microservices used by the frontend (process_query and caption_service)
# Usage:
#   chmod +x geotest/start_microservices.sh
#   ./geotest/start_microservices.sh
#
# This script:
#  - cd's into geotest/microservices
#  - installs Python deps (pip) if needed
#  - launches both services with uvicorn in the background, writing logs to files
#
# Notes:
#  - Use the foreground uvicorn commands (uncomment) if you prefer to run each service
#    in its own terminal and see live logs.
#  - --reload is included for convenience during development so the services restart on code changes.
